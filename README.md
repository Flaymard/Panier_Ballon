# Panier_Ballon

GUI project made during the second semester of my second year at INSA Lyon, with three other students. 
This is a small basketball game, made to understand the basics of graphical interfaces and also some game mechanics.

Nothing very impressive given the amount of time we had to finish this, but still a nice experience.

`java PanierBallon` to launch.
